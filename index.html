        <h1>What is a Keyboard Warrior?</h1>
        <p>
          Keyboard warriors are people who post offensive or agressive comments on the internet.
          They just hate some people without any reasonable reasons and cyberbully them on the internet.
          They usually hide their identities using the anonymity of the internet.
          <br>
          <br>
          What the keyboard warriors post are usually somethings they can not say or do in the face-to-face world.
          In the cyberspace, others can not see or hear physically them.
          Therefore, they do not need to care how others think or judge.
          They remain as physically ambiguous figures.
          <br>
          <br>
          Due to their abusive or agressive posts, many celebrities or influencers suffer.
          Many of them experience mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and panic disorder.
          Also, in severe cases, some eventually commit suicide.
