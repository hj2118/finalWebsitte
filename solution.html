        <h1>Removing Comments Section</h1>
        <p>
          As many celebrities, especially musicians and artists, suffer from keyboard warriors,
          removing comments section for the entertainment news reduce the amount of malicous
          comments on the Internet. It is not a perfect solution as the keyboard warriors
          will keep posting aggressively on any other platforms that has comments section
          like YouTube and Instagram. Also, the issue is with the keyboard warriors, so there
          should be additional effort to deal with them.
        </p>

        <h1>Internet Real-Name System</h1>
        <p>
          With this, people will not be able to make accounts without entering their real name,
          then their identities will not be fully anonymous. Keyboard warriors mostly post aggressively
          on the internet since no one knows who they are on the internet. However, with the Internet
          Real-Name System, the keyboard warriors will post less malicous comments.

        <h1>Harsher Punishment</h1>
        <p>
          Many of the keyboard warriors post aggressively, thinking they will not
          get caught and even if they get caught, the punishment is not severe.
          In fact, it is hard to catch all the keyboard warriors and to
          The punishment is not that harsh comparing to how much others suffered from
          their actions. With a harsher punishment, there will definitely be less keyboard warriors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Artifical Intelligence</h1>
        <p>
          An artificial intelligence (AI) that filters malicious comments
          and does not allow those comments to be posted will definitely beneficial.
          With such AI, the keyboard warriors will not be able to post aggressively
          at all. It will keep the Internet clean.
