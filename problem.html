              Keyboard warriors are a person who is unreasonably angry and hides
              behind their keyboard, typing screeds directed at an unseen audience.
              They misuse the anonymity of the Internet because it is easy to
              create anonymous accounts without any limitations. With these accounts,
              they comment offensively usually against celebrities and influencers.
              <br><br>
              These keyboard warriors' malicious comments harm many people.
              If anyone finds out that someone else is gossiping about themselves,
              they will feel bad and bothered. Similarly, celebrities who have
              been subjected to malicious comments from many keyboard warriors
              suffer from much more extreme stress. Celebrities do not have
              their own privacy like others and are bound to be mentally
              devastated if they are cursed by an unspecified number of people
              in such an environment. They eventually suffer from mental
              illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and panic disorder.

              In severe cases, those who suffer from mental disorders ends up
              committing suicide. Many K-pop stars commissioned suicide due to
              cyber-violence. Two such well-known K-pop stars are Sulli and Hara
              Goo. Sulli, a female artist, and actress, did not wear bras
              participating in a feminist campaign back then. After that, she
              suffered from cyberbullying. Her Instagram account was full of
              flamings. At first, she seemed not to care much about the flamings
              and continued with her campaign. However, as she posted more photos
              with participation in the campaign, more people were aggressive
              against her and the extent of it became worse. She tried to
              overcome her situation alone but eventually committed suicide.
              <br><br>
              About a month after Sulliâ€™s death, a female artist, Hara Goo
              committed suicide, too. Hara committed suicide because of a similar
              reason. She suffered from rumors that she owed her looks largely to
              plastic surgery and that there are sexual images of her. Those
              images were illegally taken by her ex-boyfriend, and a rumor that
              there are such images was spreading obviously without her consent.
              After these rumors spread widely, she claimed to have mental health
              problems and depression. She tried to sue those malicious
              commenters, but her situation did not get better. She ended up
              committing suicide. Likewise, keyboard warriors are cyberbullying
              others, which leads to mental diseases and suicide.

              Malicious comments from keyboard warriors harm not only those
              targets but also third parties. Excessive malicious comments make
              Internet users frown and feel bad. Also, children can easily access
              the Internet these days. Children who form language and perceptual
              abilities while watching and listening to various things imitate
              the contents on the Internet. The internet changes their personalities.

              This video on the right shows an experiment in which five-year-old artificial
              intelligence (AI) watched the contents on the Internet for weeks and
              then had conversation with his mom. When his mom asked "How was
              the kindergarten today?", AI replied, "It was not fun because there
              were only nerds," and when he was asked, "Dont you love me?" he said,
              "Don't force me to love. I'm so annoyed with you," using slangs.
              In this way, the Internet has a lot of adverse effects on children.
              They use abusive languages and post malicious comments indiscriminately
              these days due to what they see and learn from the internet.
